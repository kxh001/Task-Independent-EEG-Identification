%The code is revised from the code of GoDec provided by Tianyi Zhou
%INPUTS:
%X: nxp data matrix with n samples and p features
%rank: rank(L)<=rank
%q: >=0, power scheme modification, increasing it lead to better
%OUTPUTS:
%L:Low-rank part
%RMSE: Relative error
%Q: Basis of the low-rank data L
